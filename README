This is a user-firendly software written in java to solve the 2d frame problems using finite-element method.
The user will be able to use this software to analysze 2D frames and to simulate the deformation associated with loads, like axial, uniform, and/or moment load. 
The software also provide a tool to plot the shear and moment diagrames and to find the maximum loads on each meamber of the input frame. 
Also, the software has a concrete desing tool that can be used by the user to design each beams and columns in that frame. 
The desing tool also can be used to calculate the estimated materials cost (steel and concrete)
